# Aircraft-Simulation
Application of some travelling salesman problem search methods on commercial flight routes with maintenance consideration

# Description
The cost of airplane fuel is one of the important considerations for an airline in
determining the price of its flight ticket. The increase in aviation fuel prices has the
potential to cause an increase in flight ticket prices. In addition, airlines also need
to consider the schedule and place of aircraft maintenance. Aircraft maintenance
carried out at the right time and place can save the duration and cost of aircraft
maintenance. One solution that can be considered is choosing the optimal flight
route. The definition of an optimal flight route is a flight route that has a minimum
flight cost, maintenance cost and duration of maintenance. Airplane route selection
is one of the applications of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). TSP is an
optimization problem to find the best route by visiting all cities once and returning
to the initial city. This final project will discuss the selection of flight routes with
several stages, namely data collection, mathematical model design, application of
methods, program simulation and analysis of results. The methods used in this
research are Brute Force, Held Karp, Genetic Algorithm and Nearest Neighbor.
This final project aims to choose a flight route that has minimum flight costs,
maintenance costs and duration of maintenance using the Brute Force, Held Karp,
Genetic Algorithm and Nearest Neighbor methods and then compare them.
However, the program created in this final project requires a long execution time,
so improvements are still needed so that the program can run faster. The results of
this study are expected to be useful for airline companies in choosing flight routes
or can be considered when they want to increase the number of aircraft in their
airline.
