# Aircraft-Simulation
___
In this project, one airplane flight will be simulated to visit all given airports. Each airport has different distances and costs and duration of aircraft maintenance, so this simulation aims to find aircraft flight routes that have the minimum distance (flight costs), maintenance costs and maintenance duration.

# Math formulas

## Parameter definition
* $n$ is the number of airports
* $I = \\{1, 2, 3, ..., n\\}$ is the airport set
* $K = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$ is the set of aircraft age index in days
* $c$ is the flight cost matrix with $ùëê_{ùëñ,ùëó}$ is the flight cost from airport $i$ to airport $j$
* $Acost_{i}$ is cost vector per day at airport $i$ of The A check maintenance
* $Bcost_{i}$ is cost vector per day at airport $i$ of The B check maintenance
* $Ccost_{i}$ is cost vector per day at airport $i$ of The C check maintenance
* $Dcost_{i}$ is cost vector per day at airport $i$ of The D check maintenance
* $loss$ is maintenance loss which is defined from the median profit per day
$$loss = \frac{4c_{min} + c_{max}}{2}, \space\space\space  0 < c_{min} < c_{i,j} < c_{max},\space\space\space \forall{i,j} \in I$$

## Optimization Problems
$$ \sum_{k \in K} \sum_{i \in I} \sum_{j \in J} \left( c_{i,j} x_{i,j} + Acost_{i} A_{i,j,k} + Bcost_{i} B_{i,j,k} + Ccost_{i} C_{i,j,k} + Dcost_{i} D_{i,j,k} + lossA_{i,j,k} + lossB_{i,j,k} + lossC_{i,j,k} + lossD_{i,j,k} \right) $$

##### Notes:
* $c_{i,j} x_{i,j}$ is objective function of airline costs
* $Acost_{i} A_{i,j,k}$ is objective function of The A check maintenance costs
* $Bcost_{i} B_{i,j,k}$ is objective function of The B check maintenance costs
* $Ccost_{i} C_{i,j,k}$ is objective function of The C check maintenance costs
* $Dcost_{i} D_{i,j,k}$ is objective function of The D check maintenance costs
* $lossA_{i,j,k}$ is objective function of The A check maintenance time loss
* $lossB_{i,j,k}$ is objective function of The B check maintenance time loss
* $lossC_{i,j,k}$ is objective function of The C check maintenance time loss
* $lossD_{i,j,k}$ is objective function of The D check maintenance time loss
